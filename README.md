# GitHub Issues to Totango

This action takes new issues from GitHub and sends them to Totango.

## Limitations and known issues

* This action only handles three use cases: 
  * When user creates a new issue, contents of that issue are logged as a new touchpoint based on the customer id provided in the workflow.
  * Similarly, issue comments are also logged as new touchpoints
  * Touchpoints are also created when issues are closed.
* [Totango's API](https://support.totango.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000597266-Touchpoints-API) does not support markup of any kind so all formatting gets stripped.

Feature requests are welcome. Please log an issue in this repo for new requests.

## Building Code
## How To Create a New Task
The tasks API doesn't seem to be documented anywhere. To figure out what is sent to the API, use the Totango test account and Developer Tools while creating/editing a task.
### NodeJs Example
``` javascript
var request = require('request');
var options = {
  'method': 'POST',
  'url': 'https://api.totango.com/api/v3/tasks',
  'headers': {
    'app-token': APP_TOKEN,
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  form: {
    'account_id': ACCOUNT_ID,
    'description': '',
    'assignee': TOTANGO_EMAIL,
    'priority': '2',
    'activity_type_id': ACTIVITY_TYPE,
    'due_date': '2023-1-4',
    'title': 'test',
    'status': 'open'
  }
};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```
