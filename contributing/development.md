# Development

This document describes the process for developing and testing the code in this repository

## Getting started

This action is powered by Node.js!

You'll need Node.js version 16. To install Node.js, [download the "LTS" installer from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). If you're using [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), read the [`nodenv` docs](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#readme) for instructions on switching Node.js versions.

### Using GitHub Codespaces

As an alternative, you can simply use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

In a matter of minutes, you will be ready to edit, preview and test your changes directly from the comfort of your browser.
